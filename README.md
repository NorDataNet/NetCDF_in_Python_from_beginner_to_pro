# NetCDF in Python: From beginner to pro

Want to learn how to work with NetCDF files? Know a bit of Python? You have come to the right place!

This course has been designed to help you understand NetCDF files, get data out of them and create your own NetCDF files. The course is suitable for beginners who know nothing about NetCDF files and those who are new to Python. However, more experienced users should also be able to learn a lot from this course.

You may be here because you are interested in publishing FAIR data. Did you know that a NetCDF file is not necessarily FAIR unless it adheres to certain conventions? You will learn about the Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions (https://cfconventions.org/) and the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD - https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3), and how to make sure your files are compliant with them.
